                            <h4>Pre-engineering</h4>
							<h5>What is the Pre-engineering Program?</h5>
							<p>In the Atkins Pre-Engineering Program, students will be engaged by many real life style problems, and they will also go through the major steps of the design process that a real world engineer would. All of the engineering classes are geared towards project based learning that will help them to understand some of what they will go through as a real engineer. There are currently six different courses offered at Atkins, and they are:</p>
							
							<h5>What are the classes in the Pre-engineering Program?</h5>
							<ul>
								<li> <strong>Introduction to Engineering Design</strong> - In Introduction to Engineering Design, students will use 3D solid modeling software to help them design solutions to solve assorted projects that the teacher will assign. They also learn about how to document their work and how to communicate their results to the other students and teachers. It is designed for 9th and 10th grade students. The major focuses of IED are:</li>
								<li><strong>Principles of Engineering</strong> - This engineering course introduces students to some of the most common concepts that they’d encounter in college or other post-secondary education. The students will get the opportunity to explore engineering and high-tech careers and to develop skills and understanding of course concepts. Students will use engineering and scientific concepts in the solution of engineering design problems. They develop problem-solving skills and apply their knowledge of research and design to create solutions to various challenges. Students also learn how to document their work and communicate their solutions to peers and members of the professional community. It is designed for 10th and 11th grade students.</li>
								<li><strong>Digital Electronics</strong> - This course is the study of the electronic circuits that are found in essentially all of our electronic devices that need to process and control digital signals. This includes devices such as: cell phones, MP3 players, computers, digital cameras, and high-definition televisions. The major focus of Digital Electronics that differs from the previous two is exposing students to the process of combinational and sequential logic design.</li>
								<li><strong>Computer Integrated Manufacturing</strong> - The major focus of this course is to answer questions such as: “How are things made?”, “What processes go into creating products?”, “Is the process for making a water bottle the same as it is for a musical instrument?”, “How do assembly lines work?” and, “How has automation changed the face of manufacturing?” As students find the answers to these questions, they learn about the history of manufacturing, a sampling of the manufacturing process, robotics and automation. The course is built around several key concepts: computer modeling, Computer Numeric Control (CNC) equipment, Computer Aided Manufacturing (CAM) software, robotics, and flexible manufacturing systems. It is designed for 10th, 11th, or 12th grade students.</li>
								<li><strong>Civil Engineering and Architecture</strong> - The major focus of this course is completing long-term projects that involve the development of property sites. As  students learn about the various aspects of civil engineering and architecture, they apply what they learn to the design and development of a property. The course provides teachers and students freedom to develop the property as a simulation or for students to model the experiences that civil engineers  and architects face. Students work in teams, exploring hands-on activities and projects to learn the characteristics of civil engineering and architecture. In addition, students use 3D design software to help them design solutions to solve major course projects. Students learn about documenting their project, solving problems and communicating their solutions to their peers and members of the professional community of civil engineering and architecture. It is designed for 11th and 12th graders.</li>
								<li><strong>Engineering Design and Development</strong> - This capstone course (last course in a strand) allows students to design a solution to a technical problem of their choosing. They have the chance to eliminate one of the “Don’t you hate it when..” statements of the world. This is an engineering research course in which students will work in teams to research, design, test, and construct a solution to an open-ended engineering problem. The product development life cycle and a design process are used to guide and help the team to reach a solution to the problem. The team presents and defends their solution to a panel of outside reviewers at the conclusion of the course. The EDD course allows students to apply all the skills and knowledge learned in previous Project Lead the Way courses. The use of 3D design software helps students design solutions to the problem their team has chosen. This course also engages students in time management and teamwork skills, a valuable set for students in the future. It is designed for 12th graders.</li>
							</ul>
