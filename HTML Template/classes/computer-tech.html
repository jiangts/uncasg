                            <h4>SciViz</h4>
							<h5>What is SciViz?</h5>
							<p>This strand will prepare students to focus on the principles, concepts, and use of complex graphic and visualization tools as applied to the study of science and technology.  Students will use complex 2D graphics, 3D animation, editing, and image analysis tools to better understand, illustrate, explain and present technical, mathematical, and/or scientific concepts and principles.</p>
							
							<h5>What are the classes in SciViz?</h5>
							<ul>
								<li> <strong>SciViz I</strong> - Emphasis is on the use of complex graphic tools, to  understand technical, mathematical or scientific concepts. Visualization activities may include graphics of mathematical models, molecular structures, topographical maps, stratospheric and climate models and statistical analysis.</li>
								<li><strong>SciViz II</strong> - Learn advanced skills in the use of complex visualization tools for the study of mathematical and/or sciences concepts. Design and develop increasingly complex data- and concept-driven visualization models. Focus on scientific and technical concepts to learn how to communicate and analyze phenomena using statistical, graphic and conceptual visualization computer applications.</li>
								<li><strong>Game Art and Design I</strong> - This course introduces students to techniques used in the electronic game industry. Students study the principles used in game design including mathematical and virtual modeling. Emphasis is placed on areas related to art, history, ethics, plot development, storyboarding, programming, 2D visual theory and interactive play technologies. Students develop physical and virtual games using hands-on experiences and a variety of software.</li>
								<li><strong>Advanced Studies</strong> - Students work under the guidance of a teacher with expertise in the content of the completer course in collaboration with community members, business representatives, and other school-based personnel. The four parts of the course include writing a research paper, producing a product, developing a portfolio, and delivering a presentation.</li>
							</ul>
							
							<h4>Computer Engineering</h4>
							<h5>What is the Computer Engineering Program?</h5>
							<p>This strand introduces students to real world applications of computer hardware and software knowledge. The courses that are offered in this strand give students a hands-on learning environment into the vast world of computers, networking, software, and hardware. Through the study of this strand students develop skills to help them achieve their goals in future professions and studies.</p>
							
							<h5>What are the classes in the Computer Engineering Program?</h5>
							<ul>
								<li> <strong>Introduction to Engineering Design</strong> - Introduction to Engineering Design (IED) is a high school level course that is appropriate for 9th or 10th grade students who are interested in design and engineering. The major focus of the IED course is to expose students to design process, research and analysis, teamwork, communication methods, global and human impacts, engineering standards, and technical documentation. IED gives students the opportunity to develop skills and understanding of course concepts through activity-, project-, and problem-based (APPB) learning.</li>
								<li><strong>Computer Engineering Technologies I</strong> - This course introduces the essential hardware competencies for a person looking to pursue an education in Computer Engineering.  This begins with the same knowledge encompassed within an entry-level PC service technician course. This course focuses on the CompTIA A+ Core Hardware exam objectives, students are required to learn the  basic knowledge of configuring, upgrading, and troubleshooting computer systems.</li>
								<li><strong>Computer Engineering Technologies II</strong> - This course takes the introduction of  the essential hardware competencies to a higher level for a person looking to pursue an education in Computer Engineering.  This begins with the same knowledge encompassed within an entry-level PC service technician course then explores the software and operating systems end of the spectrum. This course focuses on the CompTIA A+  exam objectives, students are required to learn the  basic knowledge of configuring, upgrading, and troubleshooting computer systems along with installation of operating systems, network and security issues and configuration.</li>
							</ul>
